A series of modules for willie (willie.dftba.net) to ease the use of IRC for RPGs

Currently includes:

* nicedice: Recognizes NdM+K die rolles in the middle of text and rolls them. Supports Fate die
* rolltables: Create and edit tables to generate random results from. Saves to a JSON file

Planned:

* rolltables
    * weighted tables
    * composite tables
* npcgenerator: Generate simple filler npcs, physical description, quirks. Slaved to tables stored in rolltable perhaps?
